In the object reallocation model, when agents’ preferences are unrestricted, Ekici (2024) proves that the top trading cycles is the unique mechanism that is individually-rational, pair-efficient, and strategyproof. We prove that this characterization remains true when agents’ preferences are single-dipped.

Keywords: Object reallocation model; Top trading cycles; Single-dipped; Pair efficiency.
